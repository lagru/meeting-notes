Present: François, Lars, Stéfan, Emma (and Alex at the end)


## Agenda

- pre-release checklist:
    - [#4496](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4496), bug with
      h_minima/h_maxima 
    - [#3850](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3850) SLIC with
      mask
    - [skeletonize_3d produces a zero array in certain conditions](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3757)
    - what could be done to [simplify the release process](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4544)?
- feedback on rotating charge of repo follow-up. Very positive feedback from
  everybody who gave it a try, nice to be able to follow-up during a whole
  week. On average it takes between half an hour to an hour every day. It may
  of course vary depending on the activity of the week.
- bug report: [#4583](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4583) should rescale intensity always return out_range dtype? @jni thinks yes. Currently it returns an image in the input dtype! Several comments were added to the issue.
- decide between `selem`, `footprint`, `structure` or `neighborhood`, or `kernel` as parameter name for the structuring element, see [#4154](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4154) and [#4581](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4581). 
    - Several comments were added to
      [#4154](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4154). It
seems that `selem` (which we widely use in `morphology`) is not very popular.
- current CI failure: any idea what's going on? 
    - all Py3.7, segmentation faults / access violations after, during `segmentation/tests/test_felzenszwalb.py::test_grey` [example log](https://dev.azure.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/_build/results?buildId=2956&view=logs&j=334af232-6109-57b9-b294-3cb1e881b307&t=39339382-c83a-5968-2bb4-5c9c395c8d0a&l=5295)?
        - Looks like it's caused by the pre-install of Cython 3.0a1


## Action items

- Dig in link between alpha release of Cython and CI failure
- Check on status of Azure pipelines with Egor: is our testing well split between this and AppVeyor?  Are we using all our parallel workers with the different services optimally to ensure short builds?
- Plan release, address items of the checklist above with high priority

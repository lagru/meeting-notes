- [ ] Juan: look up pivchallenge authors and whether they will release two images as CC0.
- [ ] Juan: recap https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4087 how to do multichannel for regionprops (linked to `channel_axis` future API in order to replace `multichannel`)
- [ ] Juan: work on final names https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4951#discussion_r487472490
- [x] Emma: make our plausible.io stats public: https://docs.plausible.io/visibility/ Done https://plausible.io/scikit-image.org should be public now

- [ ] François: if needed, look for CC0 PIV images
- [ ] Lars: try to look at a few pending PRs for the release: [#4380](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4380), look for PIV images (CC0, see [#4161](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4161))
  (Post release) Rolling ball algorithm review, boundary tracing, 


## Agenda and items discussed during the meeting

- remaining PRs for 0.18 https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3A0.18
    - How to implement multichannel regionprops? https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4087
    - 3D rank filters: waiting on some small suggestions from Greg, possibly we should just take them over. https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4435#pullrequestreview-488111748
    - Euler number / Crofton perimeter: this is ready. https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4380
    - Blind deconv: looks like it needs some work! https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4717#issuecomment-659314208
    - Trainable segmentation: reviewed by several devs and modified accordingly, needs final (?) review https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4739
    - Optical flow algorithm: review required + need to check our data policy https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4161 (discussed during the meeting: ok to download the images for the gallery example)
    - Camera man 
- short demo of plausible.io analytics
- Names of datasets https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4951#discussion_r487472490
- Improve our TODOs? add link to original PR, add a draft PR so that it would be more visible (but there will be merge conflicts), or use issues with a milestone

# scikit-image meeting 2020-01-31

Join via [Zoom](https://monash.zoom.us/j/284282585)

Present: François, Lars, Emma

## Minutes

### Upcoming release

- PRs involving deprecations should be prioritized so that we do not lose a
  release cycle for planned deprecations. An "involves deprecation" label for
  PRs has been created for this purpose.
- Priority features to merge before the release: Pooch

### RGsoc projects

Ideas of good projects for beginners: 
- a couple of open PRs could be merged with a moderate effort if taken over
 (for example #3590 or #3773). This could represent a good mentor / mentee work which has huge chances to result in work which is merged.
- scikit-image equivalent of the recent "numpy for absolute beginners" tutorial
 

### Upcoming conferences and workshops

- [François] Looking for team mates to submit a scikit-image tutorial to
  Euroscipy (late July in Bilbao!), Lars will probably participate, others
  welcome to join! 
- [Emma] Pycon abstract accepted!

### Other items

Should we still support 32-bit architectures? A SKIP issue #4430 has been
opened to discuss it.

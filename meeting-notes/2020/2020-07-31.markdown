    - Add banner on website for next sprint (+ link to contributing page)
    - Add notes on how to get started with Cython in contributing guide.
- how to use ASV benchmarks better (should this be part of the weekly report?)
    - @jni: it definitely should be!!!
    - server is still up at https://pandas.pydata.org/speed/scikit-image but something seems broken
    - pull request should be covered as well, @jni explored using meeseeksDev, see https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/3342
- new CZI proposal led by Greg (deadline Aug 4)
- use of type annotations (PR https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4794) + https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4869
    - (No time to discuss but please review PRs)
- convenient documentation CI (https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/2269, tangentially https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/458, https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/2720)
    - Nelle working on #2720 (CircleCI) but may not have time
    - GH Actions easy to set up but unsure if viable to serve HTML pages served by GitHub Actions.
    - Having a zipped bundle of the doc to download would already by an improvement.
    - Overkill(?): CircleCI + Appveyor + Azure + GitHub Actions
    - Task for potential DevOps contractor (simplify CI), especially an expert
- Scikit-image Roadmap? (The CZI proposal asks how the proposed work fits into our roadmap). We have a mission statement SKIP here: https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/skips/2-values.html
    - 'living' roadmap (links to issues e.g. performance, documentation) which can still be used later
- Matomo discussed (to put on grant) 
- Other sources of funding after CZI: Moore & Sloan, NIH, EU/ERC
    - Create a repo with common materials for applications
- [time allowing...] Pillow security issue: https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4861 Not enough time to discuss.

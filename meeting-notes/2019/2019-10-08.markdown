- Thinking about how to implement ND-prominence calculation (Lars)
    - as opposed to filter techniques such as used in h_maxima
    - Max-Trees might be useful
    - use standard types from libcpp for efficient data structures while releasing the GIL
    - as by-product of ridge-detection?
- Two possible definitions for h_maxima: [H-extrema #2797](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/2797)
    - suggestion: use MATLAB's definition and
        - depreciate the old function
        - provide two implementations old and new
        - look into it until next meeting, 
- strange behavior for floats in h_maxima:

## Items from the previous meeting

- [3125](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3125) : TODO N-d rotation matrices; Josh W will take a look
- **DONE** [3173](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3173) : TODO Stéfan will take a look, apparently he is blocking that one
- **DONE** (Alex opted to remove the old pattern from the documentation, thus "forcing" the new one) [3928](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3928) : needs a more descriptive docstring for the `load_pattern` argument; TODO Alex will do
- **WIP** (A refactoring proposed in [4178] seems to solve the issues found. Needs review (cython involved); Alex will chech when he comes back) [3980](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3980): TODO need to fix discrepancy between Otsu/Multi-Otsu — Alex will take a quick look
- **DONE** [3785](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3785): TODO should be a quick fix, Juan will take a look
- Propose shorter deprecation cycle (two to one cycle) to mailing list, at least for changes where we can detect old/now incorrect behavior - Josh Warner will do


## Agenda

- Governance added! Please check for issues in https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/values.html and https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/skips/index.html
    - SKIPs should be added to documentation TOC [TODO Juan]
    - SKIP 2 formatting issue [TODO Juan]
    - Better formatting of authors [TODO Stéfan]
- Documentation builds: references are not rendered perfectly [TODO Stéfan]
- Any remaining issues for 0.16?
    - https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4187
    - https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3544
    - https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3544#issuecomment-535516956
        - settled on reference/moving for registration
        - image0/image1 for comparison
        - [TODO Juan]
- API for optical flow dtype https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4196
    - if dtype, make it actual dtype object rather than string; np.float64 maps to cnp.float64_t correctly, as with 32-bit.
    - discussions at https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4187#issuecomment-536025590 and https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4196 [TODO Stéfan to comment]
- For NumFOCUS sponsorship, we need a code of conduct. We currently have
  community guidelines only, but may benefit from using that as a summary and then adopting SciPy's CoC wholesale. See [our application in preparation](https://hackmd.io/s_hodTUFSAKRiIdibG3i-w); [TODO: Stéfan will email proposal to skimage-core list]
- Stéfan has created a mailing list for the steering council; steering council members will receive an invitation shortly
